# CS50 Problem Sets 2020

Hello everyone! I have finished all the problem sets from Harvard's Computer Science Course; CS50.

If you feel stuck in a problem it is okay to google and try to find the answers, but the most important thing is to actually learn so please do yourself a favor and DO NOT COPY AND PASTE my code onto your answer.

If you see my code and feel it can help you go ahead and use it but first understand it. 

If there is something you do not understand comment on my code, open an issue and I will answer and try to help you as soon as i see the code.

With that being said, happy coding!
